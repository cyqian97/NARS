Need update gap vertex whenever they change!
    Need extend conv chain edges


Gap associate:
    After the robot moves along a straight line without any gap events
    For each gap:
        If the same vertex and side persist:
            Accosiate
        Else:
            Check chasing or dechasing the gap
            If chasing * side = 1:
                chase the chain, accosiate the gap vertex with same side
            If chasing * side = 1:
                dechase the chain, accosiate the gap vertex with same side

Appear event:
    If event is Appear
    add the appear gap to list


add the appear gap to list

make a event structure
